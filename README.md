# PyMR-PRESSO
A Fast Python Implementation of MR-PRESSO
## üìå Overview  
MR-PRESSO (**Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier**) is a powerful method for detecting and correcting horizontal pleiotropy in **Mendelian Randomization (MR)** analyses. However, the original **R-based implementation** can be computationally inefficient, especially when applied to **large-scale GWAS datasets**.  

To address this challenge, we introduce **PyMR-PRESSO**, a **Python-based** implementation optimized for speed and scalability using **NumPy arrays**.

## üöÄ Why PyMR-PRESSO?  

### ‚ö° Challenge: Computational Inefficiency in R  
- The standard MR-PRESSO **R package** is **slow** on large datasets due to inefficient matrix operations.  
- Running outlier detection across many **genetic variants (SNPs)** can be prohibitively slow.  

### ‚úÖ Solution: Python Optimization  
- **NumPy-powered** implementation for **faster matrix operations**.  
- **Vectorized computations** to reduce redundant loops and increase performance.  
- **Parallel processing** support for large-scale MR analyses.  

### üêç Why Python?  
- **NumPy & Pandas:** Efficient handling of large GWAS datasets.  
- **Optimized for parallel computing**, reducing runtime significantly.  
- **Better memory management** compared to R‚Äôs in-memory operations.  

### üìà Impact  
- **Drastically improved execution time** compared to the R version.  
- **Scalability for large GWAS datasets** and high-dimensional MR analyses.  
- **More accessible** for researchers familiar with Python‚Äôs data science ecosystem.
